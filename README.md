# Satellite Image Segmentation using Google Search Engine

![Satellite Image Segmentation Banner](https://i.imgur.com/F2yR7fS.jpg)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to leverage Google Search Engine to obtain satellite imagery and then apply advanced segmentation techniques to extract meaningful information from these images. The segmentation process identifies and classifies different elements within satellite imagery, such as buildings, roads, vegetation, and water bodies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YooshaMirza/segmentation-of-satellite-image-using-google-search-engine.git
   cd segmentation-of-satellite-image-using-google-search-engine
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project workflow consists of three main steps:

1. **Image Collection**: Gather satellite images using Google Search Engine
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare images for segmentation
3. **Segmentation**: Apply algorithms to identify features in the images

Launch the Jupyter notebook to run the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook satellite_image_segmentation.ipynb
```

## Data Collection

The data collection process utilizes Google Search Engine to retrieve high-quality satellite imagery:

Key aspects of the data collection process:
- Automated queries to Google Image Search with specific keywords
- Filtering for high-resolution satellite imagery
- Metadata extraction for geolocation information
- Dataset organization by region and resolution

## Segmentation Pipeline

Our segmentation pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Noise reduction
   - Contrast enhancement
   - Resolution standardization

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Edge detection
   - Texture analysis
   - Color segmentation

3. **Model Application**:
   - Deep learning-based segmentation (U-Net, DeepLabv3+)
   - Traditional computer vision techniques
   - Ensemble methods

4. **Post-processing**:
   - Boundary refinement
   - Small object removal
   - Class balancing

## Results

Below are sample results from our segmentation model:
